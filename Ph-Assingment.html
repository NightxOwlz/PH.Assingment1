            <h3>One of the marvelous things about community is that it enables us to welcome and help people in a way we couldn’t as individuals. When we pool our strength and share the work and responsibility, we can welcome many people, even those in deep distress, and perhaps help them find self-confidence and inner healing.</h3>

            <h2>Education for a child</h2>
            <p> Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today.Education aims to give you a boost up the ladder of knowledge.For a small child there is no division between playing and learning; between the things he or she does ‘just for fun’ and things that are ‘educational.’ The child learns while living and any part of living that is enjoyable is also play.” ~ Penelope Leach
